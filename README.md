# BSTDplate


![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/emaballarin/BSTDplate.svg?branch=master)


A (hopefully) *no-frills* **templated Binary Search Tree** implementation using iterators, in modern C++ (i.e. C++14/17/20).

This project is a joint effort of [Leonardo Arrighi](https://github.com/LeonardoArrighi), [Francesco Romor](https://github.com/FrancescoRo) and [Emanuele Ballarin](https://github.com/emaballarin)

---

This project has been (or, more correctly *will be*, as of now!) realized as part of the examination coursework for the [Advanced Programming Course](https://github.com/asartori86/advanced_programming_2019-20) offered by [SISSA](https://sissa.it) and is compliant to at least [these specifications](https://github.com/asartori86/advanced_programming_2019-20/blob/master/exam/readme.pdf).

More information will be added as it becomes avaliable and the implementation is worked out.

As this repository currently has no purpose, we hope – at least – it will make you laugh…
